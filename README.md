## I - Overview
The competition focus on any-way any-shot learning for image classification. This is an **online competition**, i.e. you need to provide your submission as raw Python code that will be ran on the CodaLab platform. The code is designed to be a module and to be flexible and allows participants to any type of meta-learning algorithms.

You can find more informations on the [ChaLearn website](https://metalearning.chalearn.org/).

## II - Installation

Make sure you first clone the repository. Then you can directly jump to the [Starting kit](starting_kit/README.md) to get started.

This repository can be installed via a **conda** environment, check the `starting_kit/quick_start.sh` script.

### Disclamer
Some methods in the `starting_kit/tutorial.ipynb` (e.g., plot_episode()) are inspired in the introduction notebook of the recent publication code [E. Triantafillou et al. **Meta-Dataset: GitHub repository**](https://github.com/google-research/meta-dataset).
